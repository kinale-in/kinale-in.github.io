Nestled within the lush greenery of Colvale, a picturesque village along the banks of the Chapora River in North Goa, ARANYAK seamlessly blends with nature to offer an extraordinary mix of luxury and tranquillity. This exquisite 5 bed room villa, perched on a hilly slope, provides breath taking views of sprawling paddy fields and the serene Chapora Tributary, integrating with nature peacefully.

The architecture of our project in this serene setting takes you on a journey from the entrance to the vast expanse of the paddy fields, utilizing strong visual lines punctuated with thoughtfully landscaped courtyards and terraces. This journey immerses you in a dialogue between the built environment and the untamed beauty that surrounds it.

With a plot size of 2,875 sqm (3,435 sq. yds.), and a built-up area of 1,310 sqm (14,100 sq. ft.), ARANYAK serves as a haven providing an escape from daily hustle, inviting you to a life of unparalleled grandeur, with every detail showcasing meticulous design and a deep reverence for nature.

[India Sotheby’s International Realty]({{ "https://www.sothebysrealty.com/india/eng/sales/detail/797-l-3892-87tewv/colvale-goa-ga"}}) is our exclusive marketing and sales partner for this project.

<!--
As one enters the property, they are greeted by the remnants of the ancient Sahyadri mountain range, older than the Himalayas, stretching its fingers until they recede under the lush paddy fields. It is on one such piece of land that we are building a house – a home that is expansive, merging peacefully with the untamed natural beauty that envelops it while integrating state-of-the-art technology for elevated living.

The design of this home leverages the natural terrain, seamlessly integrating the various levels of the house with the contours of the land. The structure extends out from a lush food forest, establishing a gradual descent to the fields that lie ahead. This gentle transition from the built environment to the natural landscape creates a harmonious dialogue between the two, immersing the residents in the beauty of their surroundings.

As one moves through the property, they are taken on a journey of discovery, with each step revealing a new aspect of the architecture or the landscape. The use of locally sourced stone in the construction anchors the building to its context, while the generous use of glass and open spaces allows for an uninterrupted flow between the indoors and the outdoors.

The landscaped courtyards and terraces serve as extensions of the living spaces, providing ample opportunities for the residents to engage with nature. These outdoor areas are designed to be functional yet aesthetically pleasing, with carefully selected plants and water features that create a sense of tranquility and rejuvenation.

As the journey through the property culminates at the edge of the paddy fields, one is left with a sense of having traversed through a series of carefully curated experiences – from the solidity of the mountain to the serenity of the fields, with the architecture serving as a bridge between the two. It is this seamless integration of the built and the natural that makes this project truly unique, offering a living experience that is both grounded and elevated, intimate yet expansive, and deeply connected to the essence of its location in Colvale.
